# Sites

Website front-end development. Sites I’ve coded the front-end of at ion interactive. Using HTML/HTML5, CSS, and jQuery/JS. 

NOTE: ion stopped developing sites around 2008/9, since then my site development has been limited to working on ion’s websites. Currently the ion site is built within the Squarespace platform, no longer needing my attention. This site is currently managed by the CEO and marketing team.
