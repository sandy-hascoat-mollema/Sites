# Sites

Website front-end development. Sites I’ve coded the front-end of at ion interactive. Using HTML/HTML5, CSS, and jQuery/JS. 

NOTES: 

- ion stopped developing sites around 2008/9, since then my site development has been limited to working on ion’s websites. Currently the ion site is built within the Squarespace platform (not SS developer like the last iiCom site I coded), no longer needing my attention. This site is currently managed by the CEO and marketing team.

- I can provide old site code samples on request (Citrix.com, EliteIslandResorts.com, many versions of ioninteractive.com, etc…). All sites developed in CSS tableless layouts. Converting a few (Citrix.com, EliteIslandResorts.com, etc…) from tables to tables layouts.  

- I worked with ion’s engineering team on all websites when ion was a web development company. Often times coding all the front-end marked up with comments for our engineers to follow and code the back-end piece of the projects.
