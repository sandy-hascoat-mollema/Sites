You agree that Intuit, on behalf of itself, and others who administer such services (as applicable), may send Communications to you by sms text, email and/or may make Communications available to you by posting them at one or more of our sponsored websites, such as <a href="http://www.mobilepayment.intuit.com" target="_blank">www.mobilepayment.intuit.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.intuitpaymentsolutions.com" target="_blank">www.intuitpaymentsolutions.com</a>.
